# # Profitable Apps That Attracts More Users
# 
# We only build aps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. Source of revenue is mostly influenced by the number of users who uses the app.
# 
# The goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users to increase our revenue.

# We loop through the android data set, and for every iteration:
# We isolate the name of the app and the number of reviews.
# We add the current row (app) to the android_clean list, and the app name (name) to the already_cleaned list if:
# The number of reviews of the current app matches the number of reviews of that app as described in the reviews_max dictionary; and
# The name of the app is not already in the already_added list. **We need to add this supplementary condition to account for those cases where the highest number of reviews of a duplicate app is the same for more than one entry (for example, the Box app has three entries, and the number of reviews is the same). If we just check for reviews_max[name] == n_reviews, we'll still end up with duplicate entries for some apps.**

# To minimize risks and overhead, our validation strategy for an app idea is comprised of three steps:
# 
# 1. Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.
# 2. If the app has a good response from users, we then develop it further.
# 3. If the app is profitable after six months, we also build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.

# We can see that among the free English apps, more than a half (58.16%) are games. Entertainment apps are close to 8%, followed by photo and video apps, which are close to 5%. Only 3.66% of the apps are designed for education, followed by social networking apps which amount for 3.29% of the apps in our data set.
# 
# The general impression is that App Store (at least the part containing free English apps) is dominated by apps that are designed for fun (games, entertainment, photo and video, social networking, sports, music, etc.), while apps with practical purposes (education, shopping, utilities, productivity, lifestyle, etc.) are more rare. However, the fact that fun apps are the most numerous doesn't also imply that they also have the greatest number of users ‚Äî the demand might not be the same as the offer.

# The landscape seems significantly different on Google Play: there are not that many apps designed for fun, and it seems that a good number of apps are designed for practical purposes (family, tools, business, lifestyle, productivity, etc.). However, if we investigate this further, we can see that the family category (which accounts for almost 19% of the apps) means mostly games for kids.
# 
# The difference between the Genres and the Category columns is not crystal clear, but one thing we can notice is that the Genres column is much more granular (it has more categories). We're only looking for the bigger picture at the moment, so we'll only work with the Category column moving forward.
# 
# Up to this point, we found that the App Store is dominated by apps designed for fun, while Google Play shows a more balanced landscape of both practical and for-fun apps. Now we'd like to get an idea about the kind of apps that have most users.
#%% [markdown]
# To figure out which genre is the most popular, we can calculate the average number of installs or the average number of user ratings for the app. To calculate the average number of user ratings for each genre, we'll need to use a for loop inside of another for loop. The first for loop will loop through each genre in the dictionary. The second for loop will loop through the genres in the dataset to match the genre in the dictionary. If the match is found, it will tally up the ratings and the number of apps in that genre to calculate the average rating.

# # Conclusion
# In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.
# 
# Although Communication and Navigation category has the most number of installs in google play store and iOS store, it seems like the Entertainment category has more potential for success. It is able to target both adults and kids and is less dominated by couple apps. It seems like users download multiple Entertainment apps for their needs compared to Communication and Navigation where users only use the top apps in the store.
